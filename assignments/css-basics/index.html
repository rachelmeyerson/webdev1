            <h3>Why I Love It</h3>
            <p>The Devil Wears Prada is my favorite movie of all time. Not only is it just an overall fantastic feel good movie, it was also a huge part of my childhood. My mon, my sister, and I would watch this movie over and over again, to the point that I can now recite the majority of the words. It has an incredible cast, that makes fans fall in love with their characters, which keeps us coming back again  and again. </p>
